//In this game the player will use N coins numbered from 1 to N, and all the coins will be facing in "Same direction" (Either Head or Tail), which will be decided by the player before starting of the game.The player needs to play N rounds. In the k-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to k. That is, the face of coin i will be reversed, from Head to Tail, or, from Tail to Head, for iâ‰¤k . Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing N rounds. Elephant really becomes quite fond of this game COIN FLIP so Elephant plays G times. Please help the Elephant to find out the answer.
